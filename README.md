# basin-control-notebook
This is a `GitHub` site dedicated to the program used in the paper 'Control of multistability through local sensitivity analysis: application to cellular decision-making networks'.

To view a rundown of how to use the code, see the PDF file `local_control.pdf`.
To see the whole code, check the file `gradients.py`.
The two `.pckl` files are the files used for the analysis in the paper, and contain the equilibrium points (`equilibria_names.pckl`) and nominal parameter values (`nom_pars.pckl`).
These can be used to give a test-run of the functions in the script.
