This is a `GitHub` site dedicated to the program used in the paper [insert paper name].

To view a rundown of how to use the code, see the `Jupyter` notebook.
To see the whole code, check the file `gradients.py`.
The two `.pckl` files are example files with equilibrium points (`equilibria_names.pckl`) and parameter values (`nom_pars.pckl`) to use as a test-run.
